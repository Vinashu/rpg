Spell Templates
===============

These graphics are designed for use with Pathfinder (or similar
d20-like systems) and Roll20, and provide templates for marking out
out spell areas of effect.

They include both cone and burst effects.

The templates are designed for use in the 70px = 5ft scale of Roll20,
though are actually drawn at 140px = 5ft and are expected to be scaled
down. This means when zooming into the map, they still look reasonable.

NB: For very large templates, the images are 70px = 5ft, otherwise the
image size becomes insane.

Source images are created using the GIMP (some effects provided by Krita),
and stored in GIMP's .xcf format. PNGs provided for convenience.

Notes
-----

The source base images have a black background, just so that the white
border is visible.

Generally the effects layer is 50% transparent, so that the map shows
through beneath the template, making placement (and working out cover)
easier.

Images consist of:

* **Base templates**. These are white bordered with small marks at each
  vertex and a larger mark at the centre. Cones have a marker outside
  the template, which denotes the point of origin.

* **Effect**. The effect image is the image representing the base effect
  for each type of effect (fire, holy, sonic etc). This is normally
  rendered at 140px = 5ft, at the 40ft radius size. It is scaled down or
  cropped to fit to each individual template.
