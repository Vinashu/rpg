# Progress Clocks

Some resources for BitD progress clocks. Available are some SVGs for the
basic clock, a GIMP file for the bitmap image, and some generated spoke
layers for overlaying over the basic clock.

They can be loaded into Roll20 and setup as rollable tokens, so a token can
switch between each segment as the task progresses.

4, 6, 8 and 12 segment clocks are available.
